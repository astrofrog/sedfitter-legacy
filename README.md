This is the original SED fitter from [Robitaille et al., 2007, ApJS 169
328](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJS..169..328R).

This code is provided in the spirit of reproducible research. It is the same
version used for the http://www.astro.wisc.edu/protostars online SED fitting
tool. However, please note that it is **no longer actively developed**, and has
been replaced by a newer Python package that can be found at
https://github.com/astrofrog/sedfitter.

**Disclaimer:** No guarantees are made about the accuracy of the results, and
users are responsible for ensuring that the results are reasonable and that
they understand all the limitations inherent to SED fitting.

**Please report issues
[here](https://github.com/astrofrog/sedfitter-legacy/issues). No assistance can
be provided for installation issues.**
